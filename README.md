## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **First Visit**: When you open the app for the first time, a unique device ID and share code are automatically generated for you.
2. **Share Code**: Your share code allows you to sync data across devices or share with family members.

### Sharing Lists

1. Find your share code in the "Share & Sync" section on the home page.
2. Share this code with family members or use it on your other devices.
3. When someone enters your share code, their grocery lists and meal plans will sync with yours.

### Managing Grocery Lists

1. Add items to your grocery list using the input field.
2. Check off items as you shop.
3. Organize items by category using the category selector.
4. Access your grocery list on any device by using your share code.

### Meal Planning

1. Navigate to the "Meal Plan" section.
2. Add meals to specific days and times.
3. Add notes or ingredients to each meal.
4. Generate a grocery list from your meal plan with one click.

### Joining a Shared List

1. Go to the "Share & Sync" section on the home page.
2. Enter the share code provided by the list owner.
3. Your app will now sync with the shared grocery lists and meal plans.

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Issues

- **Not Syncing**: Make sure you have an internet connection and that the share code is entered correctly.
- **Missing Items**: If items are missing after sync, try refreshing the page or checking if you have the latest version of the shared list.
- **Conflicting Changes**: In case of conflicts, the most recent changes are prioritized.

### Export/Import Issues

- **Export Not Working**: Try clearing your browser cache and try again.
- **Import Errors**: Make sure the imported file is in the correct format (previously exported from this app).
