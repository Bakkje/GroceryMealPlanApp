Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 5: Access your app on your phone

1. On your Android phone, open Chrome or another web browser
2. Enter the URL that GitHub provided (e.g., `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/grocery-meal-planner/`)
3. To add it to your home screen:
   - Tap the three dots menu (â‹®) in Chrome
   - Select "Add to Home screen"
   - Tap "Add" on the popup

## Step 6: Update your app in the future

When you make changes to your app locally, update the GitHub Pages version with these commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically update within a few minutes.
